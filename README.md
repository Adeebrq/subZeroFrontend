## About
It doesnt make sense to signup for multiple platforms to invest in different asset classes, leveraging the Avalanche blockchain and chainlink's oracle we streamline the process and provide a single dApp that can trade across different asset classes, while providing industry level charting systems for technical analysis & also a smart copytrading feature which allows you to copy the best traders in the game & make money passively.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

Due to the lack of funds & SubZero operating under the Fuji testnet network, we have only implemented cryptocurrency trading for the time being. Accurate oracles for stock, commodities & other asset classes are only available on the mainnet, hence this has been kept aside for __future releases.__

Subzero only supports login via the __Avalanche Fuji testnet network & with metamask.__

The profitablity will always be 0 as the testnet oracle only updates every 24 hours. (Another testnet limitation)

In order to see a wallet under the copytrade leaderboard section they must have atleast 1 trade executed, this is done to filter out dormant users.

Subzero is not yet mobile-friendly.

2) Multiple Asset classes

Implementing chainlink's oracles we are able to feed our smart contracts with real time offchain data which enables us to mirror almost any asset in the world given there is a accurate oracle for it.

Our smart contract logics allow users to be able to mirror winning traders, so that they can enjoy the same profits with the least effort, while also implementing a dynamic percentage allocation system so anyone can copy trade anyone with custom amounts.
